### **TIMELINE**

**1980** - First contact with the computer.

**1988** - Admitted to the University of Helsinki. In the same year, Andy Tanenbaum released the MINIX OS, a Unix derivative for educational purposes that ran on personal computers (PCs).

**1988 e 1996** - I attended the University of Helsinki, obtaining a Masters in Computer Science from the NODES research group. My academic career was cut short after my first year of university studies, when I joined the Finnish army. Where I held the rank of second lieutenant, with the function of ballistic calculation officer.

**1990** - I started to learn the C programming language in his studies.

**1990** - I returned to university studies and was exposed to the Unix operating system for the first time, through a DEC MicroVAX computer with the ULTRIX OS. My Master's Thesis is titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.

**1991** - I bought a PC with an Intel 80386 processor. On January 5, 1991, he bought an Intel 80386-IBM PC before receiving his MINIX copy, which in turn allowed him to start work on what would become Linux.

**1997** - Received the "1997 Nokia Foundation Award'y" and "Lifetime Achievement Award at Uniforum Pictures".
                                                     
**1997** - Finished higher studies (1988-1997), having spent 10 years as a student and researcher at the University of Helsinki, coordinating the development of the operating system core since 1992.

**2003** - This year he joined the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), a foundation created to help develop the Linux kernel, as an OSDL fellow. Several large companies in the computer industry, such as IBM, Oracle and HP, contribute to this foundation.

### Am I important to humanity? YEA!

I am just the creator of the Linux Kernel, the fundamental basis on which several free operating systems are built, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc., in addition to Google products, such as Chrome OS and Android.<br>
More than the creator of Linux, I am an advocate of free software and open source, a model in which the product of programmers' development is released free of charge for use, modification and, in some cases, exploitation by the community.<br>
In addition to Linux, I also created git, a software used in the development of programs for version control during the testing and compilation process.
